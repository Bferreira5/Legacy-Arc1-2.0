                <h4>India Hicks Increases Followers and Sales Employing Automated Marketing with Arc1</h4>

                <p>India Hicks was blogging, using social media and conducting one-off marketing blasts using MailChimp in an attempt to move leads further along in the sales cycle. However, they lacked the tools to generate more leads, nurture leads to customers and measure the results of their marketing activities. Arc1 using HubSpot gave them the all-in-one tool they needed to support their needs and achieve their goals.</p>

                <h4>About</h4>

                <p>India Hicks is the third child of Lady Pamela Mountbatten and David Nightingale Hicks, an interior designer of the 1960s and 1970s. Through her maternal grandfather, The Earl Mountbatten of Burma, she is a second cousin to The Prince of Wales, who is also her godfather. In 2009, she introduced a line of jewelry based on her father’s famous geometric alphabet, which became an Oprah’s pick in 2012. Recently India has added home goods to her line of jewelry, apparel and accessories.</p>

                <h4>Before working with Arc1</h4>

                <p>India Hicks knew they had an opportunity to increase revenue by converting more of their web and blog traffic to leads through inbound marketing. However, they lacked the strategy and tools to realize this opportunity.</p>

                <p>All of their previous leads were generated from organic SEO efforts and captured from one bottom of the funnel call-to-action they had on their blog (Subscribe).” India Hicks was in need of a more comprehensive strategy to convert more of their visitors and followers into subscribers who could then be converted to sales ready leads, and eventually customers.</p>

                <p>Further, they couldn’t collect much information or segment their contacts because they were using disconnected tools. They could send one off email blasts using Mail Chimp, but they could not tailor their messages. There was not any nurturing from visitors to customers, they just sent out a monthly static email to their entire list.</p>

                <p>The vision was to see how prospects were interacting with the website, build profiles around them and send targeted communications to nurture them into qualified leads.</p>

                <p>After in depth analysis and planning with Arc1, India Hicks had Arc1 create an inbound marketing strategy that would bring more visitors to their website by leveraging an already sizable social media presence and turn more visitors into leads through top of the funnel offers. These leads would then be nurtured until they were ready for sales and finally closed as customers.</p>

                <p>Arc1 migrated India’s blog to the HubSpot platform and leveraged HubSpot key word tool, emailing engine and calls-to-action with related landing pages to grow her blog readers and social media followers. Now, with an all-in-one tool, they could successfully segment leads and build a pipeline to transport them to sales qualified leads using HubSpot workflows to trigger emails to the right leads at just the right time.</p>

                <h4>Conversion and Rates and Revenue Growth Show Results</h4>

                <p>The lead nurturing campaign described above helped multiply their blog readers four fold by taking advantage of their leads follower base within six months after beginning work with Arc1.</p>

                <p>Overall, utilizing HubSpot’s social media and email tools, Arc1 helped India Hicks automate their marketing activities and measure results.</p>
